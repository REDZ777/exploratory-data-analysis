This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set

**Dataset:** Electric power consumption [20Mb]
**Description:** Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

**Date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy<br/>
**Time:** time in format hh:mm:ss<br/>
**Global_active_power:** household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)<br/>
**Global_reactive_power:** household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)<br/>
**Voltage:** minute-averaged voltage (in volt)<br/>
**Global_intensity:** household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)<br/>
**Sub_metering_1:** energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).<br/>
**Sub_metering_2:** energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.<br/>
**Sub_metering_3:** energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.<br/>
